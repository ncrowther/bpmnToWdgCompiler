# Bpmn To Wdg Compiler

## Description

This utility takes BPMN generated by WDG Studio and converts it to executable WAL 

## Usage

Create a new Workflow File in WDG Studio.  
Design your workflow, then save the workflow as: 

```
[directory in which this README resides]\data\test.bpmn
```

In a command prompt, enter the directory in which this README resides and execute:

```
java -cp .\bin  converter.wdg.ibm.com.BpmnToWdgCompiler .\data\test.bpmn 
```

Upon successful execution the WAL code is generated in:

```
.\data\generated.txt
```

Back in WDG Studio, create a new WAL File and paste the contents of generated.txt.
Your code should be ready to run.  

## Bugs and Limitations
Code is not generated if BPMN process is re-entrant
BPMN process must be valid and contain only Tasks and Gateways
